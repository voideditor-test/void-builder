# Void Builder

This is a fork of VSCodium, which has a nice build pipeline that we're using for Void.

Big thanks to the CodeStory team for inspiring this.

The purpose of this repo is to run the [the Github Actions](https://github.com/voideditor/void-builder/actions) in this repo.

## What it does

This repo hosts GitHub Actions. These actions build all the Void assets (.dmg, .zip, etc), and then they store them on a release in the [`voideditor/binaries`](https://github.com/voideditor/binaries/releases) repo, and then they set the latest version in the [`voideditor/versions`](https://github.com/voideditor/versions) repo so the versions can be tracked for updating.

## Auto-updates in Void

VSCodium comes with `.patch` files, including relevant ones to auto-updating, that we manually applied to the `void` repo. See the `.patch` files for more info.
Also see `abstractUpdateService.ts` in the `void` repo, and look for "updateUrl" and "downloadUrl" in `void-builder`.

The only version that matters for updating is the version in `versions/`. The order of releases in `releases/`, for example, doesn't matter. There is also no comparison between version numbers anywhere; e.g. 1.0.2 is never compared to 1.0.3 and "not updated" because it's a lower version. However, there is a semver comparison in some of VSCodium's patches in the void repo, like `updateService.darwin.ts`.

## Docs

See `stable-macos.sh` for one of the main Actions with some comments added by the Void team.

Actions like `stable-macos.sh` run when we manually run them (this might change in the future and be listener-based).


## Notes

<details>

### We manually applied the following VSCodium patches/ to the void/ repo to make sure they are applied, because we were getting patch-apply errors sometimes:

- version0
- version1
- ext-from-gh
- update-electron
- merge-user-product
- osx/
- everything else in the top level patches/ folder except exceptions below


### We didn't manually apply these patches:

Folders:
- windows/ (doesn't seem relevant)
- linux/ (we didn't apply it, but the auto patch works)
- insider/
- helper/settings (this doesn't seem like something VSCodium should be modifying)


Top level:
- brand
- feat-announcements
- fix-eol-banner
- terminal-suggest
